# ECE241FinalProject
Project created along with a team, programmed using Verilog on a DE1SOC board, also using a Arduino and a Gyroscope
We created a "Star Wars" game, using a gyroscope as a "Lighsaber"
The gyroscope received data from the Arduino and transmitted it to the DE1SOC board. This gyropscope was positioned to block randomly
generated "bullets" on a screen.
The user would move the gyroscope as the bullets appeared on the screen.
